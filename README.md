# README

### Hi, I'm Cora.
I'm trying to learn HTML/CSS right now, so bear with me as I try to make something! ☀️


### Update 8/03 #2
Trying to figure out how npm, bootstrap, and JavaScript work. Got a little ahead of myself when I wanted to animate typing text, but I'm working on it. Will probably turn this README into a update blog (?)
on how I'm trying to learn HTML, CSS, and JS at this rate. I'm done
for the day, and looking forward to a better tomorrow.


### Update 8/03
I'm using https://www.w3schools.com/html/ to figure out HTML as I go along.

Useful links I've found:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables
https://typeitjs.com/
