# README

## Hi, I'm Cora.
## I'm trying to learn HTML/CSS right now, so bear with me as I try to make something! ☀️

### Day 2

I got so confused trying to figure out how to use and set up npm, and
[this](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-install-and-use-node-js-and-npm-mac-and-windows/)
was a lifesaver!

Bootstrap issues I ran into

    npm WARN bootstrap@4.0.0-beta requires a peer of jquery@>=3.0.0 but none was installed.
    npm WARN bootstrap@4.0.0-beta requires a peer of popper.js@^1.11.0 but none was installed.

Solved by looking at [this](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/24078).

Also no visual updates today, but I spent two hours trying to fiddle around with JavaScript
and trying to make [TypeIt](https://typeitjs.com/) work. Didn't succeed and will probably
drop it for a while and then come back to it.

### Update 8/03 #2
Trying to figure out how npm, bootstrap, and JavaScript work. Got a little ahead of myself when I wanted to animate typing text, but I'm working on it. Will probably turn this README into a update blog (?)
on how I'm trying to learn HTML, CSS, and JS at this rate. I'm done
for the day, and looking forward to a better tomorrow.


### Update 8/03
I'm using https://www.w3schools.com/html/ to figure out HTML as I go along.

Useful links I've found:

* https://typeitjs.com/
